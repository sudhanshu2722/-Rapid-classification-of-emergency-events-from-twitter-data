## Introduction
In emergency situations, immediate access to accurate information can save lives. Social media platforms like Twitter serve as real-time data sources,
where users share information about ongoing events. This project aims to classify tweets related to emergency situations using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## Dataset
We used a dataset of tweets that were manually labeled as emergency or non-emergency.

Train dataset:
Number of rows(tweets) : 7613
Each tweet contains:
Text: The content of the tweet.
Label: A binary label (0 for non-emergency, 1 for emergency).

Class % in train dataser: 
disaster(1) --->43%
not disaster(0) --->57%

Test dataset:
Number of rows(tweets) : 3263



## Project Workflow

### Data Preprocessing:

Cleaning and preprocessing tweets by removing special characters, stopwords,html tag,emails,dates,# names,IPs,Symbols and performing tokenization.

Converting text data into numerical formats using techniques like TF-IDF or Word Embeddings.
Feature Engineering:

Applying feature extraction method TF-IDF to convert textual data into numerical features for model input.

## Modeling:
Training machine learning models to classify tweets into emergency and non-emergency categories.

Algorithms used:
Na√Øve Bayes
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Ensemble Learning (Random Forest)

## Model Evaluation:
Models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure effective classification.

## Results
Random Forest (Best Model)
Test Accuracy: 79.2%

Classification Report:
Precision: 0.75 (class 0), 0.92 (class 1)
Recall: 0.96 (class 0), 0.56 (class 1)
F1-Score: 0.84 (class 0), 0.70 (class 1)
The Random Forest model outperforms other models significantly, achieving the highest accuracy and providing a good balance between precision and recall for both classes.
