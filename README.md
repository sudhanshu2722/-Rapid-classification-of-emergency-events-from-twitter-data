## Introduction
In emergency situations, immediate access to accurate information can save lives. Social media platforms like Twitter serve as real-time data sources,
where users share information about ongoing events. This project aims to classify tweets related to emergency situations using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## Dataset
We used a dataset of tweets that were manually labeled as emergency or non-emergency. Each tweet contains:
Text: The content of the tweet.
Label: A binary label (0 for non-emergency, 1 for emergency).

## Project Workflow

### Data Preprocessing:

Cleaning and preprocessing tweets by removing special characters, stopwords, and performing tokenization.
Converting text data into numerical formats using techniques like TF-IDF or Word Embeddings.
Feature Engineering:

Applying feature extraction methods like n-grams, Bag of Words, and TF-IDF to convert textual data into numerical features for model input.
Modeling:

Training machine learning models to classify tweets into emergency and non-emergency categories.

Algorithms used:
Na√Øve Bayes
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Ensemble Learning (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
Model Evaluation:

Models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure effective classification.

### Results
The best model achieved an accuracy of XX%, with a precision of YY%, recall of ZZ%, and an F1-score of AA% for emergency tweet classification.
The classification system showed significant improvement in real-time event detection.

### Technologies Used
Python: Programming language for building the project.

Libraries:
numpy, pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms.
nltk: Natural Language Processing toolkit.
matplotlib, seaborn: Visualization libraries.
